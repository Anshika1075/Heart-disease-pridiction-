# Heart-disease-pridiction-
Project Title: Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
Dataset: UCI Heart Disease Dataset
1. Purpose
The project aims to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not using machine learning.
It will support early detection and awareness of risk factors such as age, cholesterol, and
blood pressure. The work also helps in learning the complete ML process, from data cleaning
and EDA to model training and prediction in Python.
2. Scope and Boundaries
Scope: Binary classification, Data analysis and visualisation, Building and testing ML
models, evaluating model performance with metrics.
Boundaries: No treatment suggestions, No real-time integration with hospital systems, only
dataset-based predictions.
3. Glossary
Dataset: Collection of patient data.
Classification: ML method for predicting categories.
EDA: Exploratory Data Analysis
Accuracy: Percentage of correct predictions.
Precision: Model performance metrics.
ROC Curve: Graph for classifier performance.
4. References
UCI Heart Disease Dataset.
Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn.
5. High-Level Description
The system reads the dataset, cleans the data, train models, and finally predicts the output. It
also produces visualizations for better understanding, making the results easier to interpret.
6. Assumptions and Dependencies
-Dataset is accurate and reliable.
-Python environment and libraries are installed.
-Access to computing resources for dataset handling.
7. Functional Requirements
-Load and preprocess dataset.
-Perform EDA.
-Train multiple ML models.
-Evaluate results using metrics.
-Allow user input for new patient prediction.
-Generate visualization plots and reports.
8. Non-Functional Requirements
-Usability: Beginner-friendly outputs.
-Performance: Handle large datasets efficiently.
-Reliability: Consistent results with same dataset.
-Portability: Should run on any system with Python installed.
-Maintainability: Code is modular and readable.
9. Limitations
-Predictions are not 100% accurate.
-Dataset is limited and may not represent all populations.
-Not suitable for official medical diagnosis.
-Dependent on quality of input data.
10. Use Cases
Student Use Case: Learn machine learning workflow.
Healthcare Learner Use Case: Exploring help of AI in medical predictions.
General User Use Case: Enter personal data and get risk awareness.
11. Deliverables
-Cleaned dataset and preprocessing scripts.
